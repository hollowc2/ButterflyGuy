# Codex Project State

## Objective

Safely migrate Schwab ownership toward one shared, permissioned gateway without changing
live ButterflyGuy behavior or production defaults.

## Current Phase

The fake gateway foundation, atomic token manager/adapter, and readiness boundary are merged.
This isolated slice prepares a standalone credential-proof command for one fixed public quote
through the locked manager/adapter. The command is fake-tested and has not been executed,
read a real token, contacted Schwab, or changed a service. No production cutover has begun.

## Repository Findings

- SPX/NDX/XSP and host utilities independently construct `schwab-py` clients.
- Primary containers share one writable `tokens.json`; no token lock/atomic owner exists.
- `SchwabClientWrapper` combines market, account, transaction, and order capabilities.
- Candidate feed is a useful aiohttp/provider precedent but is SPX-specific and unauthenticated.
- No Redis/NATS/ZMQ/event bus exists; REST-first is the safe initial choice.

## Decisions Made

- Work only in the isolated worktree; do not touch live Compose/services.
- Keep direct access as the production default and do not migrate order submission.
- Add narrow market-data protocols/direct delegation first.
- Build an aiohttp/httpx/Pydantic read-only quote proof with hashed internal API keys.
- Build the token manager as a standalone `TokenStore` boundary before any SDK integration.
- Hold one thread/process lock across read, fake refresh callback, and atomic persistence.
- Match the installed schwab-py 1.5.1 factory signature and `TokenMetadata` wrapping through
  an injected protocol; do not import or wire the real factory in this slice.
- Keep fake client construction, operation, and every callback write inside one manager
  transaction; invalidate callbacks before releasing the lock.
- Keep `/health` as v1 process liveness. `/ready` is HTTP 200 only for injected `ready`; every
  other bounded manager state is HTTP 503 with a fixed non-sensitive state/reason code.
- Use a deterministic static fake readiness provider in the demo runner rather than wiring a
  real manager or schwab-py factory.
- Defer Redis, shared streaming, account APIs, order APIs, and token-manager cutover.
- Do not start the inactive local Docker daemon because unrelated `unless-stopped`
  containers could restart; use the equivalent localhost demo runner for this proof.

## Current Slice

- `schwab_gateway/token_adapter.py`: exact injected client-factory protocol, bounded adapter
  errors, and manager-owned construction/operation scope.
- `schwab_gateway/token_manager.py`: scoped read/write callbacks that validate and durably
  persist every rotation before returning, then become unusable before lock release.
- `tests/test_gateway_token_adapter.py`: fake SDK metadata wrapping, directly observed lock
  coverage, no-refresh/multi-refresh behavior, invalid/escaped callbacks, later failures,
  redaction, and concurrent rotation coverage.
- `schwab_gateway/api.py`: injected readiness protocol, exhaustive state-to-code mapping, and
  fail-closed default when no provider is injected.
- `scripts/run_schwab_gateway.py`: deterministic fake `ready` provider for `--demo` only.
- Architecture/state docs: readiness semantics and the explicit operator checklist.
- `schwab_gateway/credential_probe.py`: bounded one-quote proof with no response payload,
  account lookup, order/stream surface, retry, or server startup.
- `scripts/probe_schwab_gateway_credentials.py`: explicit three-confirmation entry point;
  lazy real-factory import only after the confirmations and environment validation.
- `tests/test_gateway_credential_probe.py`: synthetic token, fake factory/client/response,
  exact quote-only call, close, redaction, malformed response, and CLI refusal coverage.

## Token-Manager Tests Added

- Successful fake refresh and defensive-copy behavior.
- Missing, malformed, insecure, expired, symlinked, and non-finite token rejection.
- Revoked, manual-reauthorization, callback-failure, persistence-failure, and lock-timeout
  states without logging fake token contents.
- Thread and separate-process serialization with no lost refresh update.
- Same-directory temporary write, mode `0600`, fsync/replace flow, and cleanup after a
  simulated atomic-replace failure.

## Token-Adapter Tests Added

- Direct lock observation across token-store read, fake factory construction, operation, and
  metadata-wrapped writes.
- Exact fake reproduction of schwab-py 1.5.1 reader/writer arguments and metadata envelope.
- No-refresh and multiple-refresh paths, with every valid rotation persisted before return.
- Persistence of a valid rotation when the later fake operation fails.
- Invalid data rejection, callback expiry, and bounded error/log redaction.
- Concurrent operations serialize construction and retain both refresh-token generations.
- Every bounded manager state returns the expected fake-proven `/ready` status and bounded
  code; refresh, failure, and recovery return 200, 503, 503, and 200 respectively.

## Tests Passing

- Focused gateway credential/token-manager/adapter/API suite: 48 passed.
- Full suite: 561 passed, 1 skipped because `CI_DATABASE_URL` is only supplied by the
  real-database workflow, and 2 pre-existing warnings.
- `uv run ruff check .`, `git diff --check`, wheel/sdist builds, and `graphify update .` pass.
- The adversarial review covered command authorization, quote-only capability, token locking,
  malformed/error behavior, session close, and credential/path/response exposure; no blocking
  finding remains.

## Known Failures

None in focused tests. Docker runtime execution remains deliberately deferred because
starting the local daemon could restart unrelated containers. The credential proof is
prepared but deliberately not executed pending explicit real-credential and single-writer
authorization.

## Open Questions

- Real Schwab extended-hours/streaming/EXTO capability results.
- Final production gateway host, private-network route, and OAuth callback domain.
- Future authorization to migrate account/order operations (not granted for this phase).

## Risks

- Existing production token refresh/write races remain because the fake-proven manager and
  adapter are deliberately not wired to any current direct path.
- Raw exception logging has no central redaction.
- The foundation runner intentionally serves fake data only. The real manager/adapter are
  reachable only through the standalone, explicitly confirmed credential-proof command; no
  gateway server or consumer uses them.
- Only the collector uses the new direct market-data adapter; trade/position/order separation
  remains later work.
- New gateway code must remain disabled and isolated until shadow/session proof.
- Container runtime packaging still needs proof on a host where starting Docker cannot affect
  live or unrelated services.

## Next Exact Action

Review and merge the offline credential-proof harness without deploying. Then identify the
approved host/window/operator and prove single-writer ownership before explicitly authorizing
one real credential/token read and one Schwab quote.
